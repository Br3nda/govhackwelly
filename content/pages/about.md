##The brief

_Use government data in new and interesting ways to tackle existing problems._

The event requires small teams of competitors to produce any kind of “hack” using government data in about 46 hours - from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon. 

The end result of these hacks can be whatever the teams want; the most common are web and mobile apps, and visualisations, but teams can make anything.

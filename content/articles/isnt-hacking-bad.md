Summary: GovHack isn't about cracking security or illegally accessing Government data or services. 

GovHack isn't about cracking security or illegally accessing government data or services.

And it's definitely not about getting devs to do free or cheap work for the government.

It's not about hardware hacking, either. 

It IS about using data in new and interesting ways to solve social problems.

It IS about bringing together people from the public and private sectors to work together.

It IS about having fun, and building Cool Stuff.

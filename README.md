#govhackwelly

The code for GovHack Wellington's site :)

GovHack Wellington is taking place in early July 2015 in Wellington, New Zealand. We're bringing together coders, artists, storytellers, observers, communicators and more, from the private and public sectors.

The brief? To use government data in new and interesting ways, to tackle existing problems.

More details soon!
